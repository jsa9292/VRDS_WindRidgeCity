EasyRoads3D Pro Demo Project

This package is complimentary to the EasyRoads3D Pro package
It includes additional side objects and road types which you can use in your own projects.
The demo scene includes featured areas highlighted with red lights including links in the Inspector to tutorials, http://www.unityterraintools.com/tutorials.php
These tutorials cover the more advanced features of the EasyRoads3D package.

Note: The demo scene opens with the road network in Build mode. In this state the toolbar tabs in the Inspector are locked. Press the "Back To Edit Mode" button in the Inspector to view the setup of the various roads, road types and side objects.

Also note that the scene itself is intended for learning purposes to get familiar with the tool. The scene is not optimized and does include various 
more complex objects targeting high-end machines.


Important:

Side object and road type data might change in future updates. 
Please keep that in mind when importing updates when you use this package in your developement project.
It may override changes you made to specific settings.
It is recommended to import this package in a new project and export / import those assets you like to use in your own projects.
